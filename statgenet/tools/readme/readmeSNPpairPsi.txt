Input.

Input 9 numbers of corresponding genotypes for SNP pair.

Output.

psi^(1) for SNP1 and SNP2 as well as psi^(2) for the pair are output in the matrix "PSI".
Corresponding allele frequency of SNP1 and SNP2 and 4 haplotype frequency are shown in the matrix "Allele frequency". For SNP1 and SNP2, chi-square test result is attached.

LD index values of D' r^2 square root of r^2 and Dg(1)(1) are displayed in the area of "LDindex".

Ln(L) as a function of psi^(2) from the lower to the upper limit of psi^(2) are plotted on left. Number of plots is 101. Nominator of the first derivative of Ln(L) is plotted in the graph on right.
